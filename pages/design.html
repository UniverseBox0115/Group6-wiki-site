            <p>Purpose/Advantage: Improve mechanical properties, increase flexibility, improve thermal properties, enhance chemical resistance, etc.</p>
            <p>1. low nitrogen (NH3) conditions activate expression of endogenous promoter PglnA</p>
            <p>2. Introduction of phaG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa to promote medium and long chain PHA synthesis</p>

            <h1><strong>Pathway 2: </strong>Inhibition of cell division promotes cell elongation and self-sedimentation</h1>
            <p>An important factor in the high cost of PHA production is the high cost of downstream processing of bacterial cells and the intracellular product PHA. Smaller cells not only make it more difficult to separate the bacterial biomass from the culture broth, but also limit the amount of PHA particles that can be stored in each cell.</p>
            <p>Since the strain itself needs to proliferate by division, in order to ensure its normal proliferation and at the same time to achieve the transformation of the strain into filamentous cells. For the transformation, we expected to achieve a controllable regulation of the strain, and therefore constructed the IPTG induction system of MinCD.</p>

            <h1>Pathway 3: </strong><br/>Low Salt Concentration to Control Bacterial Suicide to Prevent Contamination by Escaping</h1>
            <p>Measurement of the ambient salt concentration in the utilised fermentation broth as a threshold value below which the bacteria die, reducing the potential risk.</p>
            <p>EnvZ-OmpR two-component system: a histidine kinase that senses the salt concentration in the environment. When the salt concentration in the environment is low, EnvZ phosphorylation decreases and OmpR dephosphorylates, OmpR acts as a transcriptional regulator.</p>
            <p>HigBA system: endogenous TA system, HigB acts as a toxin and HigA acts as an antitoxin. HigB acts as a toxin protein that can inhibit cell growth and stagnate cell growth by affecting intracellular translational processes, etc. HigA binds to HigB to form a complex, which neutralises the toxicity of HigB and maintains normal cell growth. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, if the intracellular environment changes, HigA is degraded, the inhibitory effect on the toxin disappears, and the cell initiates suicide.</p>
            <p>The ectA promoter, a promoter regulated by OmpR, is selected. Construct a recombinant plasmid by linking the HigA gene to the downstream of the ectA promoter by homologous recombination. When the salt concentration in the environment is low, OmpR dephosphorylates and activates the ectA promoter, which inhibits HigA gene expression and initiates the suicide procedure. Plasmid construction and transformation: Transform the recombinant plasmid containing the ectA -HigA gene expression cassette into the target bacteria. The plasmid can be introduced into the bacterial cell by electrotransformation, chemical transformation and other methods, so that it can be stably expressed.</p>
